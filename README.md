then the user must enter the file location of the patrons text file. If successful, the output will display that the new patrons were added. If option 2 is chosen, which is to remove a patron, then user will input need to input the 7-digit ID of the desired patron needing to be removed. If the id isnt in the sytem the output will display that the ID doesnt exist. If ID does exist the output will display the patron that was successfully removed. Finally, if option 3 is chosen, which is list all patrons, The output will display all the current patrons within the system.
