Project Description
-----------------------------
This purpose of this project is to create a new software system for a local librarie to manage patrons. The system will allow librarians to add patrons, remove patrons via ID, or list all current patrons. 
This system is called the Library Management System. 

Input/Output
-----------------------------
The expected input for the the LMS is to for the user to choose an option from 1-3 from the menu on what they would like to do with patron information. If option 1 is chosen, which is to add a patron,
then the user must input all of the information the system ask about the patron which includes the patrons 7-digit ID, name, address, and overdue fine. If the ID isnt 7 digits long the output will display
that the ID is invalid, and if correct, the output will show that the user was successfully added. If option 2 is chosen, which is to remove a patron, then user will input need to input the 7-digit ID of 
the desired patron needing to be removed. If the id isnt in the sytem the output will display that the ID doesnt exist. If ID does exist the output will display the patron that was successfully removed. 
Finally, if option 3 is chosen, which is list all patrons, The output will display all the current patrons within the system.
